- This is the chrome dino game. But using your hand.


## How to play
- The point is that more than 1 finger up will get the dino to jump.
- So once you run it,just put up more than 1 finger and scream jump dino jump

## How to start
- So since thresholding is used, you will need to initialize a background.
- To do that point at a static place like a wall. And click r and then b. This will reset your background and then capture an image
- You might change the threshold slider if you want to for better detection
- Then when you put your hand in the frame youll see results

## Why so complicated? Why no deep learning?
- I dont have a GPU
- You dont need a bazooka to kill a chicken
- It will be slow and you will lose fast

## Why is it not working?
- Your hand is not being detected. Change the threshold values
